# 🧠 Machine Learning Introduction

### &#x20; <mark style="background-color:purple;">What is MLM?</mark>

A machine learning algorithm is the process that uncovers the underlying relationship within the data.&#x20;

The **outcome** of a machine learning algorithm is called [**machine learning model**](./), which can be considered as a `function` F, which outputs certain results, when given the input.

Rather than a predefined and fixed function, a machine learning model is derived from **historical data**. Therefore, when fed with different data, the output of machine learning algorithm changes, i.e. the machine learning model changes.

### Different types of functions

**Regression**: The output is a scalar (输出是一个数值).

**Classification**: Give options (classes), the function outputs the correct one.
